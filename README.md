# Companies House Streaming
This app was created to experiment with using Retrofit2 to consume a streaming API, and to experiment with using Jetpack Compose in fragments, and using the navigation component with fragments.
The API used is the [Companies House Streaming API](https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/streaming-api/guides/overview).
